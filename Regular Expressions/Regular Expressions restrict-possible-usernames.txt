Solution is split into two parts:
1. ^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z]+\d*$
2. [A-Za-z]+\d\d+$

Part 1: (covers usernames such as: "JACK", "AB1", prevents "BadUs3rnam3")
Get one letter at the start, get at least one additional letter, check if any numbers exist at the end of the string

Part 2: (covers usernames such as "Z97")
Get at least one letter at the start, get one number, get at least one additional number at the end of the string
